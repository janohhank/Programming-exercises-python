##	* The program have to possible to handle the wrong user inputs and warnings the user how to use the program.
##
##	* When you use 3rd party code from stackoverflow or other source, always reference this in the code in a comment.

# 3. task
# Create a function which has parameters: 2D vector coordinates.
# This function calculates and returns the magnitude (length) of the vector.

# 4. task
# Create a function which has two parameters: two Python list with numbers.
# The function join together the lists, the first list element next to the second list element etc...
# After that returns the result list.
# listA(a,b,c), listB(1,2,3,4) -> resultList(a,1,b,2,c,3,4)

# 0. task
# After this comment write the tests of the defined functions.
# Call the function with correct and wrong parameters also.
# Handle the possible errors.
