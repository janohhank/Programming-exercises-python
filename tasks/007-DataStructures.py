## General info:
##	* The created program have to communicate in english with the user.
##	  Furthermore the code variables/methods/classes etc... be named in English.
##
##	* The program have to possible to handle the wrong user inputs and warnings the user how to use the program.
##
##	* When you use 3rd party code from stackoverflow or other source, always reference this in the code in a comment.
##	  Even if you modified the code.

## Task: 007-DataStructures:
## The main focus of this task is to get more knowladge of the data structures of Python
## and also get the a general programming knowladge about this topic.

## A. List
## Python data structures documentation: https://docs.python.org/2/tutorial/datastructures.html#more-on-lists
## Based on the tutorials above:
## A/1. Create a list filled with random data.


## A/2. Print the list elements.


## A/3. Print the list elements reverse.


## A/4. Add elements (min 2) and remove elements (min 2) from the list.


## A/5. Print the list size.


## A/6. Print just the list elements which index is odd.


## B. Dictionary
## Python data structures documentation: https://docs.python.org/2/tutorial/datastructures.html#dictionaries
## Based on the tutorials above:
## B/1. Create a dictionary filled with random data.


## B/2. Print the dictionary elements (key, and value also).


## B/3. Add new element into the dictionary.


## B/4. Remove element from the dictionary.


## B/5. Get a value which associated to a specific key.


## C. Algorithm on data structures
## C/1.	Create a list with random numbers, and implement an algorithm
##	which can sort the elements of the lists.
##	Don't use sort() method!
##	Don't use 3rd party code!


## C/2.	You got input, in this case the 'carsColors' list.
##	We want to know the count of the cars according to their color.
##	In this task you must use dictionary to store the information and get the numbers.
##	Print the colors and the count of the cars which has this color.
carsColors = ['red','blue','red','white','white','red','blue','red','white','white','black','grey']
