## General info:
##	* The created program have to communicate in english with the user.
##	  Furthermore the code variables/methods/classes etc... be named in English.
##
##	* The program have to possible to handle the wrong user inputs and warnings the user how to use the program.
##
##	* When you use 3rd party code from stackoverflow or other source, always reference this in the code in a comment.
##	  Even if you modified the code.

## Task: 003-FibonacciSequence:
## Create a program, which calculates the Fibonacci sequence elements.
##
## The program's input is a number, which defines the required n'th element.
## The output of the program is the first nth element of the Fibonacci sequence.
##
## Extra task-1: Create the Fibonacci calculation method with recursive and iterative logic too.
## Extra task-2: Change the program to calculate exactly just the n'th element of the sequence (closed-form of the expression).
