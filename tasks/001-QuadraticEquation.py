## General info:
##	* The created program have to communicate in english with the user.
##	  Furthermore the code variables/methods/classes etc... be named in English.
##
##	* The program have to possible to handle the wrong user inputs and warnings the user how to use the program.
##
##	* When you use 3rd party code from stackoverflow or other source, always reference this in the code in a comment.
##	  Even if you modified the code.

## Task: 001-QuadraticEquation:
## Create a mini program, which can calculate a predefined quadratic equation.
##
## The program's inputs are the ax^2 + bx + c = 0 equation [a,b,c] coefficents.
##
## Warning: the 'a' input can't be zero!
## Warning: the equation possibly has complex root!
##
## Extra task: Show the equation in a figure with matplotlib.
##
## Not complex test input: 6x^2 + 11x - 35 = 0
## Complex test input: 1x^2 + 2x + 3 = 0
