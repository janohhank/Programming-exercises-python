## Task: 011-RunningCompetition
## We have information about a running competition, but a we got a little problem.
##
## The players identification numbers and laptimes are in a text file, and we can't create statistics about the players whole perfomance.
## This text file's first column is the ID number and a second is the laptime in second.
## What are these statistics:
##	- Every player total runtimes (sum of laptimes). Player ID - total runtime.
##	- Sorted list about the total runtimes. Best 10 players.
##	- What was the best single laptime and who did it?
##
## Also we have another file which contains the player identification numbers and the players name.
## We want to know the best 10 player names also, to we give them a medal.
