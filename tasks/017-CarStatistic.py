## Task: 018-CarStatistic
##
## In this task you need to read and write spreadsheet files (in this time .ods files).
## The used resource file is: CarStatistic.ods
##
## You need to interpret the contents of the file. This is a simple table of a car usage.
## After that you need to read the file content in Python with "pyexcel_ods" library.
## Of course if you find another ods reader library in Python and you can use that.
##
## 1. Write the value of all distance traveled in kilometer into the standard output.
##
## 2. Write the value of all refueled gasoline in liter into the standard output.
##
## 3. Calculate the car average consumption (consumption per 100 kilometers).
##
## 4. Calculate the average price of 1 liter gasoline.
##
## 5. Which refueling was the most expensive in 1 liter / Ft.
##
## 6. Create a code which can add a new row into the ods.
##    Add new refuling statics into the spreadsheet.
